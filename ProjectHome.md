# Webserver Malware Scanner #
Webserver Malware Scanner is a simple script for detecting and analyzing web-based threats. It currently handles exploitkits, shells, obfuscated JavaScript codes, Executables, Iframes and port scans.

Works so far on all linux based systems.

PS: Do not forget to use 'dos2unix scanner.sh' on your unix box OR you will get errors ( see our issues list )
